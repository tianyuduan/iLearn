### 3 pillars of good html and css

  process: load html -> parse HTML -> Document Object Model (DOM)

                        load CSS at parse -> parse CSS


parse CSS: resolve conflicting CSS declarations (cascade) + process final CSS values -> goe to the CSS object Model (CSSOM) -> render tree -> website rendering: the visual formatting model-> final rendered website

Cascade: process of combining different stylesheets and resolving conflicts between CSS rules and declaration, when more than one rule applies to a certain element.
